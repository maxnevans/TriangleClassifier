# Triangle Classifier

Can classify traingle by given edge sizes to:
- basic;
- isosceles;
- equilateral.

Used techonologies:
- algorithm library (`std::sort`);
- range based `for` loop with index (address arithmetics);
- constructor reusing in derived classes (`using` keyword);
- `array` as a fixed count triangle edges;
- russian console locale (`setlocale`).
